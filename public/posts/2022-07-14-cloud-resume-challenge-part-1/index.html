        <p>I&rsquo;m the kind of person who is never done with learning and trying to align my skillset with industry demand. I&rsquo;ve done a lot of VMWare training and certification over the years and decided it was time to branch out to one of the popular public cloud offerings.</p>
<p>While researching Amazon Web Services courses and certifications I stumbled across the Cloud Resume Challenge. The challenge is a 16 step project designed to show off the skills typically required of a cloud engineer, specific to the flavour of cloud provider you are interested in (AWS, Azure, or Google).</p>
<p>Here are the steps I took as part of the challenge, they are referenced from the Cloud Resume Challenge website</p>
<p><a href="https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/">https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/</a></p>
<h3 id="step-1-certification">Step 1: Certification<a href="#step-1-certification" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>For this I had to sit and pass the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification. (More details on this certification <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/">here</a>)<br>
I used Stephane Maarek&rsquo;s Ultimate AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner – 2022 Udemy course (<a href="https://www.udemy.com/share/103a093@Xyy5BUVKwUTNgK4T9fYuttnh2s3pKp7w8ogebGWcUkt4f_lZ2kycxHVTRAWWeMC-wQ==/">Link</a>) as well as his 6 practice exams (<a href="https://www.udemy.com/share/103e7s3@nproIormrwH46Z8rw68C34SfBvUi69yf-VseCS0INp1bETewtEUfUJFqxveq6m9CCg==/">Link</a>).<br>
I found Stephanes course to be tightly packed and didn&rsquo;t drag on too much, if you didn&rsquo;t quite understand a particular topic you could always dive into it more using AWS&rsquo;s available resources.<br>
The practice exams gave very detailed explanations of the available answers and highlighted areas where I needed to study more.<br>
I sat the exam from home and was told to check in half an hour before my exam time. I really needed that extra half an hour as the identity and room setup verification took nearly that whole time.<br>
I passed the exam with 803/1000</p>
<h3 id="step-2-html-resume">Step 2: HTML Resume<a href="#step-2-html-resume" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>When I first left school I signed up to do a Network engineering course. It had a very small module on web design and coding, that was the last time I ever wrote in HTML. A poster on Reddit suggested finding some inspiration on a site called <a href="http://codepen.io">Codepen.io</a>. There I found a clean simple template that I could use as a starting point.<br>
I saved my code to my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/wgarbutt/CloudResume/blob/main/index.html">here.</a> (Spoiler alert, you can see the finished project <a href="https://will-garbutt.me">here</a>)</p>
<h3 id="step-3-css">Step 3: CSS<a href="#step-3-css" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>My resume needed to be styled with CSS. I would be the worst choice for a game of Pictionary and my design imagination is non-existent. I scoped out <a href="http://codepen.io">Codepen.io</a> again and luckily found a suitable template for my css file. I made a number of adjustments and learnt quite a bit about css while I was at it.<br>
I link to this file on my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/wgarbutt/CloudResume/blob/main/style.css">here</a></p>
<h3 id="step-4-static-website">Step 4: Static Website<a href="#step-4-static-website" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>My HTML files are stored on an AWS S3 bucket configured to be a static website. I found this to be pretty straight forward to setup. Here is the steps I needed to do to configure a AWS S3 static website.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Deploy your empty bucket. You&rsquo;ll need to name the bucket the same name as your domain. AWS uses the host header in the web request to route traffic to the appropriate bucket
<img src="/Images/CloudResumeChallenge/image1.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configure the bucket for static web hosting. On the properties of your bucket you should see an option “Static website hosting”, Select the option “Use this bucket to host a website”, enter “index.html” as the index document</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your bucket is now configured for static website hosting and you should have an S3 website URL listed at the bottom of the bucket property page</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-56-dns-and-https">Step 5/6: DNS and HTTPS<a href="#step-56-dns-and-https" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>I purchased myself a domain name <a href="http://will-garbutt.me">will-garbutt.me</a> for around $50. The challenge suggests using AWS Route 53 to host the DNS for your domain but since I am also doing some Terraform learning and playing with deploying resources using code I found that AWS considers a domain that was stood up, deleted, and stood up again to be two domains and charging me $10 each time I try.</p>
<p>For this I used Cloudflare as it has a well documented Terraform provider module and is free no matter how many times I have deployed and destroyed resources. In my Terrafrom GitHub Repository (<a href="https://github.com/wgarbutt/Terraform">link</a>) I have both AWS and Cloudflare code to setup DNS.</p>
<p>Cloudflare also has a simple way to enable HTTPS with just a click of a button.</p>
<p>Part 2 will be coming soon!</p>
